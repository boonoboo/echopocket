## Info

Original name: Zvex Fuzz Factory
Clone name: Die Factory
Own name: Farvebrikken
Type: Fuzz
Settings: **Volume**, **Gate**, **Comp**, **Drive** and **Stab**

"Farvebrikken" comes from the two Danish words "farve" (colour) and "fabrikken" (the factory), which together form the name "the colour factory". This colour comes both from the colourful appearance of the pedal, which again reflects how many "colours" the tone of the pedal can have. The factory part of the name comes from the circuit being a clone of the Zvex "Fuzz Factory".

I bought this pedal kit from Musikding because I wanted to have a versatile fuzz pedal and this was the kit with the most knobs. To me, more things to turn must automatically equal more versatility, so I bought the kit as well as a 125B case to squeeze it into, wanting to mimic the form of the original Fuzz Factory as much as possible.

## The Build

I started this build by soldering all the components onto the PCB, as is common. Delirious from the soldering fumes, I then started soldering the 3PDT and potentiometers to the PCB and each other, giving me a complete, testable circuit which was also a complete mess. I plugged in my guitar, turned on the amp and was greeted with a terrible squealing noise. "Fuck, I guess you can't solder transistors directly onto the PCB after all" I thought to myself.

Turns out, it's supposed to sound like that. After playing a bit with the potentiometers, I got a relatively clean (for a fuzz), distortion-like tone. Cool, let's try turning another knob! Suddenly the sound cuts. Uhh, ok, let's turn that back, then try another knob. Nope, there's the squealing again.

After some research, I realized that the pots are like an insecure group of friends: take out one of them and the dynamics change completely. Tired of trying to figure out which pot was which, I decided to house the circuity before continuing.

To house the circuity, I had to drill an enclosure for the first time. Why is that such a big deal? Because I wanted everything in the pedal to be perfectly aligned and my tools for the job are a pencil, a ruler and a cordless drill. Afraid of joining the "poorly made Fuzz Factory clones" club on /diypedals, I ended up putting off the project for four months before I decided to just go for it. It turned out alright, the holes aren't exactly aligned, but expanding the holes a bit gave me enough wiggle room to make the pedal look nice.

## The Sound

Given that this is my first fuzz pedal, I don't have too extensive a frame of reference. In fact, I only started to notice the use of fuzz pedals after buying and making the pedal! However, I'll do my best to describe the sound of the pedal in objective, understandable terms.

It's bonkers.

You have five knobs to turn and they're all somewhat connected to each other.

### Vol(ume)

As far as I know, this is the only straightforward control that does what you'd expect. Turn volume up, the volume goes up, turn it down, it goes down.

As with other fuzz, overdrive and distortion pedals, this is best used to adjust the volume to the right level after you've found the tone you want.

### Gate

**Gate** is a noise gate, sort of. Honestly, I'm not sure what it does. It's important to the pedal, though, because of how it interacts with **stab**.

### Comp(ression)

- velcro fuzz

### Drive

### Stab(ility)

Stab controls the voltage provided to the rest of the circuit. When it's turned to max, you get all 9V and the rest of the pedals functions "normally"; the circuit is "stable".

As you turn **stab** down, things get weird. The first thing you'll notice is that if your **comp** is at full, you'll get a constant squealing sound when you're not playing. Turning **gate** up eliminates the squeal.
