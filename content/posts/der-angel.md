## The build

This was the first guitar pedal I assembled and painted myself, so building it was a learning experience.

Painting the pedal took forever. I wasn't sure how much prep you had to do for a nice finish, so I did all of it: sanding it down with a low grit, then a high grit, 2-3 layers of primer, then 3-4 layers of spray paint. I live in an apartment with a tiny balcony, which I thought I'd use for painting so I could go out, paint, then go back in while it dries rather than having to stay outside and wait between coats of paint. This turned out to be a really awkward setup as getting the right distance and angle for painting was difficult, plus my girlfriend had to close the balcony door behind me every time to avoid paint getting into the apartment.

After a first failed attempt, I sanded down the enclosure and tried again, which gave me an alright result. In total, I think I had to do the balcony shuffle about 10 times in total. Sorry Thea!

And then, when I went to assemble the pedal, I chipped the pedal with a pair of pliers.

Fuck's sake.

Turns out this was a good thing after all. Realizing that this pedal could no longer look perfect, I just did whatever seemed intuitive. I camouflaged the hole in the paint using an acrylic marker, then drew a line all the way around the pedal to camouflage the patch job. The light/dark blue combination gave me the inspiration to mark the potentiometers with overlapping waves in blue and orange and just like that, the pedal was done!

## The sound

Chorus is typically subtle, you don't really notice it's presence but it "fills out" the tone very nicely. However, the sound of "Der Angel" might be a tad too subtle.

The **rate** knob adjusts the frequency of the modulation. A low rate adds "fullness" to the tone while a high frequency acts more as a vibrato, making the sound "wobble" in pitch. I'm personally not a fan of the high frequency settings, as I think they sound like something from an old-school sci-fi movie, so I tend to stick to a setting no higher than ~10 o'clock.

The **depth** knob adjusts how much the chorus affects the sound. I'm not going to go into physics here, but it's not just a wet/dry mix, changing the depth also changes the characteristics of the chorus. The chorus is barely audible until ~12 o'clock. From about ~2 o'clock, the modulation begins to take on a square wave LFO or tremolo characteristic.

So far, I've found two settings that work relatively well:

- Rate and depth both at ~10 o'clock adds a very subtle chorus effect that you don't notice while playing with it on, but will notice when you turn it off and the sound suddenly feels slightly more "flat".
- Rate maxed out, depth at ~9 o'clock adds a slight vibrato and playfulness to the tone that works well with fingerpicking and terribly with rhythm playing.

The main problem with the pedal is how subtle the effect when the depth is low and how tremolo-like the effect becomes at high depth.

## Fate: _Shelf of Fame_

I have a soft spot for this pedal, as it was the first one I assembed and painted myself. I especially like the icons I came up with for **rate** and **depth** because they also serve as artwork for the pedal.

Sadly, the sound of the pedal didn't do it for me. When using the pedal, I hardly noticed the effect and I would typically just leave it turned on at a low-low setting because why not, a sign that the pedal doesn't have enough of an impact on the sound of the pedalboard. After buying a TC Electronic 3rd Dimension, which sounds noticably "chorussy" without the odd LFO-like sound, I decided to move the pedal from the board to the trophy case.
